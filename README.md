ðŸ“Š Empowering Insights: Unveiling Global Terrorism Trends with Power BI

In today's interconnected world, understanding terrorism trends is not just a matter of security but a necessity for informed decision-making and proactive risk management. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Power BI, I am thrilled to share my latest project that sheds light on the complex dynamics of global terrorism. Let's delve into the key findings and visualizations that offer valuable insights into this critical issue:

ðŸŽ¯ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Taliban Dominance: The dataset highlights the prominence of the Taliban within the context of terrorism.

- Massive Impact: A staggering 175.23K total targets have been recorded, underlining the significant human and infrastructural toll.

- Peak Year: 2017 emerged as the year with the highest frequency of attacks, signifying a crucial period in recent history.

- Weapon of Choice: Explosives have consistently been the preferred method of attack, posing significant challenges for counter-terrorism efforts.

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations:

World Map: Geographical insights reveal terrorism hotspots, aiding in targeted interventions and resource allocation.

Donut Chart: Understanding attack types illuminates the modus operandi of terrorist groups, informing preventive measures.

Bar Graph: Regional success rates facilitate risk assessments and strategic planning, enhancing preparedness across different geographies.

Line Graph (Total Attacks per Year): Temporal evolution analysis offers vital context for trend analysis and future forecasting.

Success Rate by Name of Group: Profiling different groups' success rates aids in threat assessment and prioritization of security measures.


This Global Terrorism Dashboard is my first task as a power BI developer intern at InternCareer. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive and informative dashboard that visualizes global terrorism trends and patterns.
